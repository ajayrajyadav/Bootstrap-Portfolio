                                Experienced Technical Lead with a demonstrated history of working in the computer software
                                industry. Skilled in Software development, Team Building, Functional Management, Java, and
                                Rational DOORS. Strong engineering professional with a MS focused in Computer Science from
                                National University. I have worked with C++ and Java programming languages for most of my
                                career. In 2014, my manager asked me to hire some new grads at Northrop Grumman. I
                                interviewed many candidates and one thing I realized is that I was becoming ancient in this
                                industry. So I decided to quit that job and find something new and be on-hands programming
                                lead position.
